# Phlock

A music-sharing platform that sits on top of Spotify and Apple Music, designed to make sharing frictionless, recognize fan influence, and give artists new ways to activate and reward their communities.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the development of Phlock across different platforms and stages:

### Branches

- **`main`** - Stable releases and production-ready code
- **`web-prototype`** - Current web prototype (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **`web-v2`** - Future web application improvements
- **`mobile-native`** - Future native mobile app development
- **`api-backend`** - Future backend API development

### Current Status

**Active Development**: `web-prototype` branch
- React + TypeScript + Vite web application
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Synthetic data for demonstration
- Deployed to Vercel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phlock.git

```

### Deployment
The web prototype is automatically deployed to Vercel from the `web-prototype` branch.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Web Prototype** (Current) - Basic functionality with synthetic data
2. **Web V2** - Enhanced web application with real APIs
3. **Mobile Native** - React Native or native mobile app
4. **Backend API** - Node.js/Express API for data persistence

## Contributing

This is a personal project. For development:
1. Create feature branches from `web-prototype`
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Merge back to `web-prototype` when ready
4. Promote stable versions to `main` branch

# Phlock Logo Design Brief

## What is Phlock?

Phlock is a daily music curation app that turns song sharing into a social ritual. Each user picks **one song per day**, and listens to a personalized 5-song playlist curated by the five friends in their "phlock."

**Tagline:** *"phlock: heard together"*

### Core Concept

The name "phlock" is a play on "flock" — a group of birds that move together. In Phlock, your flock is your inner circle of 5 friends whose daily song picks become your soundtrack. The app creates intimate, ephemeral playlists that refresh at midnight.

### Key Product Pillars

1. **Daily Ritual** — One song, every day. Simple constraint that creates meaning.
2. **Intimate Circles** — Your phlock is just 5 people. Quality over quantity.
3. **Social Currency** — How many phlocks you're in reflects your taste influence.
4. **Collective Listening** — Music as connection, heard together.

## Visual Ethos & Aesthetic Direction

### Personality Keywords

- **Intimate** — Small circles, close friends, personal curation
- **Rhythmic** — Daily cadence, musical flow, natural timing
- **Warm** — Human connection through shared taste
- **Minimal** — One song, five friends, clean simplicity
- **Playful** — Music is joy, sharing is fun
- **Sophisticated** — Elevated taste, curated not algorithmic

### Design Language (Current App)

The app currently uses:

- **Typography:** Lora (serif) — adds warmth and sophistication to an otherwise minimal interface
- **Color Philosophy:** Primarily black and white with system-adaptive dark/light modes
- **Brand Accents:** Spotify green (#1CBF34) and Apple Music red (#FA432A) for platform integrations
- **UI Tone:** Clean, spacious, content-focused — music and friends are the stars
- **Copy Style:** Lowercase, casual, friendly ("build your phlock", "heard together")

### Current Logo Concept

The existing in-app logo (`ColorfulPhlockLogoView`) features:

- A central gray node representing "you"
- An inner ring of 6 colorful dots (rainbow spectrum) rotating clockwise
- An outer ring of 12 dots (extended palette) rotating counter-clockwise
- Animation: dots appear sequentially, then rotate continuously

This represents the network/community concept but may be **too complex for a logo mark**. We're open to entirely new directions.

## Logo Requirements

### Must Convey

1. **Togetherness / Community** — A group, a flock, people connected
2. **Music** — Sound, rhythm, listening, audio
3. **Intimacy / Small Circles** — Not a massive social network; tight-knit groups
4. **Daily / Ephemeral** — There's a time element, a refresh, a cycle

### Nice to Have

- Reference to the number 5 (your phlock size)
- Something that works with motion/animation
- Nod to birds/flocking behavior (subtle, not literal)

### Avoid

- Generic music icons (eighth notes, headphones) unless reimagined
- Overly corporate or tech-startup aesthetic
- Complexity that doesn't reduce well to small sizes
- Anything that feels like a dating app or generic social network

---

## Technical Requirements

### Formats Needed

- **App Icon** (1024x1024 master, iOS guidelines)
- **Logo Mark** (standalone symbol)
- **Wordmark** (if applicable — "phlock" text treatment)
- **Combined Lock-up** (mark + wordmark)

### Usage Contexts

- iOS app icon (with rounded corners applied by system)
- In-app header/splash
- Marketing materials
- Social media profiles
- Light and dark backgrounds

### Color Flexibility

The logo should work in:
- Full color
- Single color (black or white)
- Monochrome with accent

## Inspiration & References

### Conceptual

- **Murmuration** — The fluid, synchronized movement of bird flocks
- **Vinyl grooves** — Concentric circles, the physical form of music
- **Sound waves** — Ripples, frequencies, shared vibrations
- **Constellations** — Points connected, small patterns with meaning

### Tonal

- The intimacy of a mixtape made for a friend
- The ritual of a daily coffee or journaling practice
- The exclusivity of a private listening party
- The joy of saying "you have to hear this song"

### Apps with Strong Visual Identity (for mood, not copying)

- Poolside FM — retro warmth, playful sophistication
- Are.na — minimal, intellectual, community-driven
- Locket — intimate, daily, photo-focused
- BeReal — ephemeral, authentic, anti-algorithm

---

## Deliverables

1. **3-5 initial concepts** exploring different directions
2. **Refinement round** on selected direction(s)
3. **Final logo package** with all formats and color variants
4. **Simple brand guidelines** (colors, spacing, usage dos/don'ts)

---

## Summary

Phlock is about the magic that happens when five friends share one song each day. The logo should feel like an invitation to that daily ritual — warm but not saccharine, musical but not cliché, social but intimate.

We want something that feels like it could be etched into vinyl, stitched onto a jacket, or glowing on a phone screen at midnight when the playlist refreshes.

*heard together.*

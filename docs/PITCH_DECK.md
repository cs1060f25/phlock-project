# Phlock: VC Pitch Deck

Based on the guidance from the Kleiner Perkins podcast, here's a structured pitch for Phlock that emphasizes the "why," founder passion, and market timing.

---

## Slide 1: The Why (Most Important Slide)

**"Music discovery is broken. Algorithms killed the mixtape."**

Remember when your best friend burned you a CD? When someone's music taste told you everything about them? That feeling of "you HAVE to hear this song" — and the connection it created?

Streaming killed that. Spotify's algorithm doesn't know your soul. Apple Music's recommendations don't understand your friendships. We've gained 100 million songs and lost the human connection that made music meaningful.

**I built Phlock because I was tired of discovering music alone.**

Every week, I'd find incredible songs and have no one to share them with — not really. Sure, I could text a link. But there was no feedback, no ritual, no social proof that my taste mattered to anyone.

**Phlock turns music taste into social currency.**

---

## Slide 2: What Is Phlock?

**One sentence:** Pick one song per day. Listen to your 5-person "phlock." Build reputation by being in other people's phlocks.

**The mechanic:**
- You curate exactly 5 friends into your "phlock"
- Every day, you pick ONE song to share with them
- Your daily playlist = your 5 friends' picks
- Your "phlock count" = how many people have you in their phlock

**The insight:** Constraints create meaning. One song forces intentionality. Five friends forces curation. The result is a daily playlist that actually matters.

## Slide 3: The Keurig Analogy (Business Model)

**Keurig didn't sell coffee. They sold a ritual.**

Phlock doesn't sell music. We sell the ritual of discovery.

| Keurig | Phlock |
|--------|--------|
| One pod = one cup | One song = one day |
| K-Cup variety = choice | 5 friends = curated variety |
| Machine = gateway | App = gateway |
| Subscription = recurring revenue | Premium tier = recurring revenue |

**Revenue streams:**
1. **Consumer Premium** ($4.99/mo): Advanced stats, unlimited sends, ad-free
2. **Artist Intelligence** ($29-299/mo): See your advocates, reach fans directly, presale access
3. **Affiliate/Transactions**: 10% ticket sales, 5-10% merch/streaming

**Projected**: $500K+ MRR at 500K users

---

## Slide 4: Why Now? (The Timing Slide)

Three forces are converging:

**1. Algorithmic fatigue is real**
- 67% of Gen Z say they trust friend recommendations over algorithms (Spotify's own research)
- TikTok proved songs spread socially, not algorithmically
- BeReal proved daily constraints create engagement

**2. The creator economy needs new rails**
- Artists can't reach their own fans on Spotify
- Label deals are broken — artists need direct relationships
- The $33B music streaming market has no social layer

**3. Cross-platform is finally possible**
- Spotify and Apple Music APIs now support deep linking
- Universal song matching works (ISRC codes)
- OAuth flows are seamless

**The window:** BeReal proved daily rituals. TikTok proved social music. No one has combined them. That's Phlock.

## Slide 5: Traction (Proof of Momentum)

*[This slide would include actual metrics — for the pitch, I'd recommend these categories:]*

**Early signals:**
- TestFlight beta live with [X] users
- Daily song picks averaging [X] per user
- [X]% day-7 retention
- Average phlock size: [X] of 5 slots filled
- Organic waitlist: [X] signups

**Qualitative:**
- "I haven't missed a day in 3 weeks" — Beta user
- "My phlock has better taste than any playlist" — Beta user
- "I finally feel like my music recommendations matter" — Beta user

**Engagement loops working:**
- Users who fill all 5 phlock slots show [X]% higher retention
- Streak feature driving daily return: [X]% users have 7+ day streaks
- Notification-driven re-engagement: [X]% open rate

---

## Slide 6: Product Demo (Supplement to Passion)

*[Live demo or video showing:]*

1. **Pick your song** — Search, select, add a note
2. **See your phlock** — 5 friends' songs, album art, playable
3. **The reveal** — "Give one to get five" gate (you must pick to see)
4. **Social proof** — "3 people played your song" notification
5. **Phlock count** — Your influence metric growing

**Key UX insight:** We blur the phlock until you pick. Reciprocity drives the loop.

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape

| | Spotify | Apple Music | Last.fm | BeReal | **Phlock** |
|--|---------|-------------|---------|--------|------------|
| Discovery model | Algorithm | Algorithm | Passive tracking | N/A | **Peer-curated** |
| Daily constraint | No | No | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Social feed | Minimal | None | Activity log | Photo feed | **Music feed** |
| Cross-platform | No | No | Yes | N/A | **Yes** |
| Influence metric | None | None | Scrobbles | None | **Phlock count** |

**Key differentiator:** We're not competing with Spotify for listening. We're competing with group chats for sharing. And we're winning because we're purpose-built.

---

## Slide 8: The Team

*[Include founder backgrounds, relevant experience, and why YOU are the right team]*

**What makes us uniquely qualified:**
- Deep music industry relationships
- Mobile-first product experience
- Understanding of social dynamics at scale
- Authentic passion for the problem (we ARE the users)

---

## Slide 9: The Vision

**Year 1:** Nail the daily ritual. 100K users. Prove retention.

**Year 2:** Launch artist tools. 500K users. First revenue.

**Year 3:** Platform partnerships. 2M users. Series A.

**The long-term bet:** Phlock becomes the social layer for music that Spotify, Apple, and YouTube can't build themselves. We're Switzerland — platform-agnostic, human-powered discovery.

**Exit paths:**
- Acquisition by streaming platform (Spotify, Apple, Amazon)
- Acquisition by social platform (Meta, TikTok, Snap)
- Independent growth to IPO (if we crack artist economics)

---

## Slide 10: The Ask

**Raising:** $[X]M Seed

**Use of funds:**
- 50% Engineering (iOS polish, Android, backend scale)
- 25% Growth (invite systems, viral loops, creator partnerships)
- 15% Artist Tools (intelligence dashboard, presale infra)
- 10% Operations (legal, customer support, compliance)

**Milestones to Series A:**
- 500K MAU
- 20% D30 retention
- $50K MRR from premium + artist tools
- 3 artist case studies with measurable fan activation

## Appendix: Why This Founder? (The Passion Slide)

*[Personal story — this is what Randy Komisar said matters most]*

> "I've been the friend who makes the playlist. The one who texts 'you HAVE to hear this.' The one who feels genuine joy when someone discovers an artist through me.
>
> But there's never been a way to know if my taste matters. To see if my recommendations actually land. To build reputation for something I care deeply about.
>
> I built Phlock for people like me. The curators. The tastemakers. The friends who care.
>
> Music is how I connect. Phlock is how I prove it."

## Key Pitch Principles Applied

Per the VC guidance from the article:

1. **Lead with "Why"** — The first slide is entirely about motivation and the problem
2. **Use analogies** — Keurig model makes the business instantly understandable
3. **Show passion** — Appendix slide for personal story, demo for product love
4. **Answer "Why Now?"** — Dedicated slide on market timing
5. **Prove traction** — Anecdotes + early metrics (even if small)
6. **Be the evangelist** — The whole pitch should feel like this is the only thing you could be building

## Notes for Delivery

- **Don't read slides** — Know this cold, speak from conviction
- **Expect the thermostat reaction** — VCs may initially dismiss "a music app" — be ready with the vision pivot ("we're not building a thermostat, we're reinventing every unloved product in the home")
- **Prepare for "Why Now?"** — This will be asked. Have the three-forces answer ready.
- **Bring receipts** — If possible, show real beta user testimonials, screenshots of engagement
- **End with a question for them** — "What would you need to see to believe this could be a $1B company?"

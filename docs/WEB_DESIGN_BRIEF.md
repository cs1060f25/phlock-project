# Phlock Website Design Brief

## Product Overview

**Phlock** is a daily music curation app where users pick **one song per day** and listen to a 5-person playlist from friends they choose. The core loop is simple: discover, share, connect through music.

**Tagline:** "heard together"

### Core Concepts
- **Daily ritual:** One song per user per day builds streaks and commitment
- **Phlock of 5:** Each user curates a playlist from 5 friends (their "phlock")
- **Social currency:** Your value = how many phlocks include you
- **Midnight refresh:** Swaps and new songs take effect at midnight

## Brand Personality

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Intimate** | Music sharing among close friends, not broadcasts |
| **Curated** | Quality over quantity—one deliberate choice daily |
| **Playful** | Light social pressure (nudges), friendly competition |
| **Modern minimal** | Clean, uncluttered, lets the music breathe |
| **Warm** | Personal connections, not algorithmic coldness |

---

## Typography

### Primary Font: Lora
- **Style:** Serif, elegant but approachable
- **Weights used:** Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold
- **Character:** Warm, editorial, slightly literary—stands apart from typical tech sans-serifs
- **Fallback:** Georgia, serif

### Secondary Font: DM Sans (if needed for UI elements)
- Clean sans-serif for functional text
- Weights: Regular through Bold

### Usage Guidelines
- Headlines: Lora Bold, larger sizes (32–48px)
- Subheadings: Lora SemiBold (20–24px)
- Body: Lora Regular (16–18px)
- All lowercase for brand name ("phlock") and key action words ("discover", "share", "connect")

## Color Palette

### Core Palette
| Role | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Background | White (#FFFFFF) | Near-black (#0A0A0A) |
| Primary text | Black (#000000) | White (#FFFFFF) |
| Secondary text | Gray (#6B6B6B) | Gray (#9B9B9B) |
| Accent | System default / Black | System default / White |

### Principles
- **High contrast:** Black and white foundation ensures legibility
- **Minimal color:** Let album artwork provide the color
- **Subtle depth:** Use opacity (0.1–0.3) for card backgrounds, not competing colors

### Accent Notes
- Avoid bright, saturated brand colors that compete with album art
- If accent color needed, consider warm neutrals or muted tones
- Green reserved for success states (daily song committed)

## Visual Style

### Layout
- **Generous whitespace:** Let content breathe
- **Card-based UI:** Rounded corners (16–20px radius)
- **Centered content:** Especially for key screens (welcome, onboarding)
- **Vertical rhythm:** Consistent spacing scale

### Imagery
- **Album artwork is hero:** Large, high-quality covers dominate the experience
- **Profile photos:** Circular, modest size
- **Logo:** Circular/rotating motif—the "phlock" logo rotates continuously in the app

### Motion
- **Subtle, purposeful:** Spring animations, smooth transitions
- **Swipe gestures:** Horizontal swipe for skip, vertical for dismiss
- **Page indicators:** Animated dots for carousels

### Iconography
- Simple, line-based icons
- Consistent stroke weight
- Minimal fills—outline style preferred

---

## Tone of Voice

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lowercase for brand and key words | ALL CAPS (except CTAs if needed) |
| Short, punchy sentences | Long explanations |
| "Your" and "you" — personal | Generic "users" |
| Friendly but not childish | Corporate jargon |
| Confident without hype | Buzzwords and superlatives |

**Examples:**
- "pick one song. that's it."
- "five friends. five songs. your daily playlist."
- "the best curators get followed."

---

## Responsive Considerations

### Mobile First
- Most users will discover via phone
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Full-width CTAs on mobile

### Desktop
- Centered, max-width container (1200px)
- Phone mockups to show the mobile-native experience
- Consider parallax or scroll animations for engagement

---

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Optimize images (WebP with fallbacks)
- Lazy load below-fold content
- Fast initial load—minimal JavaScript

### Accessibility
- High contrast maintained
- Semantic HTML
- Alt text on all images
- Keyboard navigable

### SEO
- Clear meta titles and descriptions
- Open Graph tags for social sharing

## Assets to Prepare

1. **Phlock logo** (SVG, multiple sizes)
2. **App screenshots** (iPhone 14/15 Pro frames)
3. **Lora font files** (or Google Fonts link)
4. **DM Sans font files** (optional, Google Fonts)
5. **Social images** (OG image 1200x630)
6. **Favicon and touch icons**

## Reference & Inspiration

Consider these design references for tone and execution:
- **Spotify Wrapped** – celebration of personal taste
- **Read.cv** – clean, typography-focused
- **Linear** – minimal, high-contrast, modern
- **Are.na** – understated, content-first

---

## Summary

Phlock's website should feel like an invitation to a small, intentional music community—not a loud app launch. Lead with the core ritual (one song, five friends, every day), use restrained typography and color, and let the product's simplicity shine through clean design.

**Key takeaways:**
- Serif typography (Lora) for warmth and distinction
- Black & white foundation—album art provides color
- Generous whitespace, card-based layouts
- Mobile-first, focused messaging
- Lowercase brand voice, confident but friendly
